												#DevLife
Hello Placid Hakiz Here so I am an advanced learner In programmning so right now I am taking things on another level I want to start working on projects Because I have been Learning programming everyday for About 4Months and I was learning all the basics that can get me to start doing the Projects that why I have this Topic of #DevLife because I do think that it is the
right time for me to start working on projects so that to get all the things that  I have learned and make sure that it become my second Nature because that it is the most important things that many developers are using the other things is just
the technology to get the job done very quickly and that means that it is time to move from baby stage and start to walk 
so Here I have A list of Projects that I have to working on and orient everything. So I can say that if I manage to build all
this projects I do believe that I will be on good stage and the great thing is that I will be doing that but also learing 
through my mistakes and also getting to know how to build a real life application and also getting the skills so this is the
only thing that is goin to get me very far and I am very excited so WITHOUT THE BLESSING OF GOD I AM NOTHING SO THAT'S WHY I 
DO NEED THE PRESENCE OF GOD AS HE WAS WITH ME ALL THIS 4 MONTHS SO I DO NEED HIM TO BE WITH ME SO THAT I CAN THEN REACH TO MY DREAMS OF BECOMING A DEVELOPER WITH ONLY 6 MONTHS OF EXPERIENCE AND GETTING TO LAND JOB AFTER THAT 6 MONTHS AND I DO BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING WILL BE BASED ON HOW I MANAGED TO LIVE THIS #DEVLIFE ROUTINE so I don't to announce anything about it
what I have to do is just get started and then After this months if it worked well I will then start to announce myself as a 
sub-junior Developer who are willing to get a place in development environment and I do want that time to associate with the 
developers and have many friends who are already developers who made it and land a job so I do believe that connection in this field just matters because knowing the skills is one thing and being able to use it. it also another skills so this is 
the thing that  I will be doing in the 6 month while learning how to use the FrameWorks so that to get my job running very
quickly so let me Elicit all the project : BACKEND AND FRONTEND TECHNOLOGY 


							PROJECTS BACKEND-TECHNOLOGY
							---------------------------
Here I will be developing atleast 3 basic projects but which are very real so this projects will have including everything that I have learned which are using OOPs concept and using DATABASES 
			
			1.BANKING SYSTEM
				so this banking system will be working like how banks the difference is that it will be working on the console because as for now I don't know how to use a desktop application because I have never learned it 
				because my laptop can't support this strong IDE so the things that a bank can do I am going to be doing it 
				lastly I have done an ATM projects which was great but by that time my laptop crashed and I lost all the files and I have learned that I have to save my things on gitHub so that to be self aware of my things


				1.Login & create Account
					here we will be able to check if an account is in our databases and if it is so we allow the user to login so this System will be working as an online platform so that whever a user is might be able to 
					login and for creating an account there we will be able to create an account for the user and account 
					must be automatically generate his/her account number and from there the user must give up all his/her
					information first name last name. and being able to choose if the account is a saving account or a regular account.

				2.Checking The balance 
					here a use will be able to check his balance and get to see the amount of money that he has on his or 
					account.
				3.Deposit 
					also we know that In the banking system they should be a deposit so will be able to depose the
					users account and also being able to show the user that he has deposited the amount of money as 
					the message.

				4.Withdraw
					also A user has to be able to withdraw the money and a user has to Enter the password inorder to confirm 
					that he is going to withdraw that money and also we have to check if he has that amount inorder to withdraw.

				5.Transfer 
					Here a user is able to transfer money from one user who are in the same bank directly and being able to 
					check that those money has already get to the destined person and check that the amount of the one who 
					transfered on his balance he has that amount to do that transaction and after checking we have to check if the account he/she wants to transfer is valid if not then we notify the user.After all those checkings
					we have to check if the balance of the sender has reduce that amount he/she transferred and check if the 
					receiver account has money increased on his/her account.

			So if I managed to build this application as How I have said that will be it as the first project and there is alot into it and the OOP is in there and also the Collection and DataStructures are included and the most thing
			is the security and Database are also included so this will be a great app that  I should also present to anyone 
			who asks me to show what I have build so far as a backend developer.



			2.Parking and CarWash System
				This project will be more advanced because it will be having all the Advanced feature even though it is 
				just easy hearing but this project will be having two running Part in it so this is a hybrid System for 
				this we don't have to use that the user it is just a listing System and I have used to work on System like
				this at School where we Built a parking System but that time it was not efficient as it will be right now 
				because for this stage then I will be developing it by myself and the cool things is that will be a system
				that I wish that I can give to someone after that I develop a Desktop App for it or making The Online app
				for it so that the owner should be able to check how many cars Was parked through out the day and the 
				system will be able to count each time a car is parked and get to register it dates and time that it parked
				and knowing if it is carWash purpose or for Parking purpose so that to generate the amount to be charged 
				so this app is more clitical and I do believe that it is hard to do it so I do thing that it will take my skills to a good state I believe .


				1.Administrator Account
					Here They will be an administrator account that will be able to check into the database and check everything whether it is only car wash or parking and this account will be more secured because 
					Entering into it an admin should be able to Enter His or Her password so that to get to enter into 
					it and he has the priviledges to check everything that it is running.
				2.Register Account
					This account is for The one who are hired just to Write out the vehicles that are in the parking field
					and being able to register them  and he will be able to see the car that he/she registered and the cool
					thing is that it will also display the time that the vehicle has Entered and He/she will be able to tick
					out if a car has paid whether it is for washing or Parking but for parking they will be a cost for that 
					so that the fees will be calculated automatically.so this app looks like it is simple but to build it 
					it is more trick and I  do think that it will take me some time to come up with this solution and I do 
					think that it is what I will be working on lastly After that I merge it with graphical interface from 
					the front end so it will be my third app to develop.





								PROJECT FRONTEND-TECHNOLOGY
								---------------------------
So this one is very crucial because it is one of the part that I do love also and the great thing is that I tend to make something which was a picture and turn into a reality that is functioninng so that's why I have a room also to apply what
I have learned of the Gui where I will be using HTML|CSS and JavaScript this means that I will be Working on two tasks at
the same that working on the backend which is really cool and it is giving me a sign of what it is looks like to become 
and frontend developer and also what it is looks like to become a fullStack developer what I will be lacking is the security
that is embedded with how the fullStack develop task looks like but it is the thing that I will looking to do about after that I have already built those projects and I do believe that If I managed to build all those application will be a good 
starting out for me and that is what I love as I have promised to myself I can't live any day without coding a good Developer
should live and breath programming and that's how I do want to live because I love programming and I can't see myself doing 
other thing except from programming and this is the real me and that's why I can like this thing because it my thing coding 
even though right now I am not at a great place but it is the thing that I enjoy myself doing and the great thing is that 
everyday I am getting better and I am getting to know more associated with it so here is the projects that I will be working
on those projects are about cloning two website looks and make it functioning and at the end as the third project I will 
be working on the Gui of One Project From the backend to the level that  I will be able to merge the front end and the 
backend and by that time I will be a full Stack Learner and that is the first goal that I will be expose to because I know
that for the thing I have learned to merge backend and frontend because I don't know it then I will be using documentation
which means it is also part of learning and that's how I will get to know it.

			1.Clone HEC site One page
				this is the page that I have seen when I was helping my Sister to Apply for Her Scholarship and I have seen the way it works that it is really cool and I wished that I should then Try to build that and Add all functionality that is associated with it which is javaScript which means I will be having fun so the purpose
				is to be able to use the skills that I have learned into use so that to get familiar with those skills I have seen that if you are not using those skills to forget them it is way more easily that's why everyday
				I have to work on it both frontend and backend because if not like that I can forget them pretty easily.

			2.Clone First page of StackOverFlow 
				That is the greatest Site for most of the developers who are willing to get answers instantly that is very trick to them and I want to be able to clone it the way it looks even though I can't add it functionality but at list I can make it live to me and also making it responsive which will be my main target to buiding 
				all of this applications or projects what I do want is to be able to build a responsive app which are mobile
				friendly because nowadays most of the applications are accessed via mobile so it is better that I design a 
				cool app like that and that is how I can learn more than the level that I was on and I will be excited building that projects.

			3.Design CarWash&Parking Project
				So this project I will be working on making the gui for that project which I will be already worked on in 
				the backend side and I do think that it will be that amazing to do and that will really give me a good confidence that I am capable of becoming a fullStack developer which I was dreaming of when I start out so the thing is that if things goes well that will be my first project that can work pretty much similar like 
				a web application which taking alot market nowadays and I will be very excited to do such thing even though
				it will be working online but the great thing is that  I will be able to have that Application that I could
				show to anyone that I was able to build an App from frontend to backend and I have to put all the power into it and i do believe that with that being able to build it I will then be able to start to work on 
				builing richard project and Bemba project by that Time I will be able to show them the Application that I
				have built and they will give me that confidence of helping them to build that great app that should be my
				first gateWay to apply for jobs and even getting client I do believe that once you expose yourself other 
				people when they like your projects they will orient others also to build for them that thing and that is the great thing that I am waiting to see and I do believe that all of those I will be doing them.

				and on the side of building Richard's and Bemba site that time I will be using FrameWorks and also using
				IDE because that time I will be working on a serious project I do believe that before Deploying them I will
				be finding those experienced developer like nelson and kim to help me out and check for me what is right and
				what is not right and how I could add the security to that website so that it can not be accessed by anyone 
				so if I managed to build that first application and deploy it then I will be able to build my own portfolio
				and also getting ready to work on upWork and freelancer which are the platforms where we can work remotely and they are one of the jobs that are available nowdays so that why it is the thing that I am looking over
				to be doing and I do belive that all those things I will be able reach out on them very soon in this year 
				or 2020 before that I turn into 21 years old.

				so I have that belief that by thi year I will be having that title of a junior Developer and from that I wish that I can end this year having a company that I am working in so that I can be able to feed mySelf and helping out my Mother in all Her hustles She is now sick because her Arm is not working very well so 
				please God allow me to get all those achievement as soon as possible so that I can start taking care of Her
				ofcourse it is not easy but the one who worked so hard you have promised them to give them the reward.

				so that's it and the great thing that I have found is that my left fingers has started to work way better
				as the left hand without thinking on it which was the thing that I was wishing to have and Now it is started to work just like that and it is really amazing that my all fingers are now working pretty 
				well so this will increase my productivity and also I do believe that I will end this  month having a 
				great automatism which most of the developers are not having and that will be a great advantage to me because when someone regulary or the developer sees that you have a high typing speed so the he will give you some respect and say this guy he knows all of that because he has been developing many projects .

				One last that I have to talk about is about improving my problem solving skills I do know that I am not to the level that I want to be on so that  I can be a good logical thinker so even though I will be developing a real world projects every single day I want also to have  a great time to develop my skills on coding challenge so this means that in the morning I will be working on backend project up to 1:00PM ,and from
				02:00PM I will be working On Frontend Projects which will be ending at 08:00PM and I will then start to work on my coding challenge like learning how does really ARRays Works because I have seen that I still have that problem in arrays that's where I will be learnig all of those skills how to correct a given question very quickly and also I will be learning well the dataStructure and getting to know them very well
				by implementing them I have found that being a good backend developer or any problem solver in this field so that to shine out as an active developer you have to be someone who thinks well in the right time and being able to deliver the solution in very short amount of time so that is my dreams in this #DevLife journey and what I want to develop is the discipline to be able to think well  every hour not to say that I am able to solve problems only in the moring that is a poor mind I have to be able to thing well anytime when there is  a kind of problem that has occurred but I have found that taking some breaks it is also part of this things but I have to work also for 16hours per day so that I should be able to stand strong and being able to have alot done within very short amount of time what I want is clear is being able to become a good software developer within only 6 months which is a half of year and it is possible because many have tried it and it works and many land a good job after having that 6 months of experience in the industry so that why I do want to work like that and I do believe that I will be good in logical thinking in this August and also may be I should not be someone who are writting good code but atleast I should be someone who is able to provide a solution to any programming question that is arised.so this will create a better way of writtin a clean code which I can like starting knowing how to work less lines of code but which are self explonatory for me and anyone who would like to tak a view on my code but if you are a beginner you are not able to figure out what it that but I do thing an advanced Learner should always writting less line of code so that to not confuse him/her when it is time of debugging because having a big function with alot lines of code lead to confusion so  I will try to avoid that even in this coming projects which will be starting tommorow .
				GOD IS MY EVERYTHING ....A REAL SUCCESS PRICES SERIOUS SACRIFICIES...FIRST AND FAST THAT MY MOTTO...
